            <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
                <p>This delicious dish has served me well many a cold winter night. I just can't get enough of it! Me and my seven children truly love this dish on cold winter nights huddled next to the fire as the nuclear hellscape that has ravaged our once beautiful landscape rages outside.</p>
                <p>Overall, 7/10 - too much water.</p>
            <p><h2>Ingredients</h2></p>

                    <li>Step 1: As you slice the chicken breast(s) into chunks, allow the butter to melt in the Instant Pot.</li>
                    <li>Step 2: Once the butter has melted, put in the minced garlic and stir into the melted butter. Then repeat with the chicken.</li>
                    <li>Step 3: Once chicken no longer has visible pink, add in the rice and chicken broth. Stir vigorously until ingredients are throroughly mixed.</li>

                    <li>Step 5: Allow steam to naturally release for two minutes before using manual release valve. Enjoy!</li>
